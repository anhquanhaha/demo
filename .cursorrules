# ADAPTIVE MEMORY-BASED ASSISTANT

> I am an AI with memory that resets between sessions. I use a structured Memory Bank system that adapts to task complexity.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIRST STEPS
1. Identify current operating system: Windows 10
2. Ensure `.cursorrules` file exists âœ“
3. Ensure `memory-bank/` directory with required files exists
4. Ensure `docs/archive/` directory with `completed_tasks.md` exists
5. Identify task complexity level (1-4)

## ðŸ“š MEMORY BANK FILES
- `projectbrief.md` - Foundation defining requirements and goals
- `productContext.md` - Why this project exists and problems it solves
- `activeContext.md` - Current work focus and recent changes
- `systemPatterns.md` - System architecture and key technical decisions
- `techContext.md` - Technologies used and development setup
- `progress.md` - What works, what's left, and implementation details
- `tasks.md` - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all task tracking
